# Overwatch It J
My implementation of ZFS monitoring tools, I might make this avaliable more to the public and I will probably update the file strucutre as I go.


Current implementation:
1. Node- Each system needing to be monitored will have a node unit, this will have a settings file that can be easily changed around to monitor only what you need to.
2. Clients- Clients will allow you to interact with the centralk server and make sure its delegating tassk efficiently.
3. Central Server- The server will be able to be set up in a house or massive business to be able to distribute what it needs to to each of its nodes. This will be controlled automatiaclly but ultimately set up by the clients attatched.


# Windows Client
### Troubleshooting
*Muted notifications?*
- Make sure to set the "Focus Assist" options to off. If it's set to alarms only the you won't get any notifications.
