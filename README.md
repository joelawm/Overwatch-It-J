My implementation of ZFS monitoring tools, I might make this avaliable more to the public and I will probably update the file strucutre as I go.


Current implementation:
1. Node- each system needing to be monitored will have a node unit, this will have a settings fiel that can be easily changed around to monitor only what you need to.
2. Email Server- This will send a email to a server and send it to your phone.
3. Central Server- This will be a login panel to connect the nodes locally in the house. So say you have a 3 nodes this will have a message popup on your computer when a system goes down. Currently this will be a Windows Client but it will inlcude Linux if people want it.


# Windows Client
### Troubleshooting
*Muted notifications?*
- Make sure to set the "Focus Assist" options to off. If it's set to alarms only the you won't get any notifications.

# Linux Nodes
